# Sales Dashboard
Power BI dashboard to analyze sales by region, product and time.

This Power BI project explores real estate sales data from 2000 to 2022. The goal is to identify trends in the housing market, understand the distribution of property types, and compare assessed values with actual sale amounts.


The report includes:

Total Houses Sold: 1.09 million
Total Revenue: 445 billion
Assessed Value: 309 billion

Main visuals:
1.Yearly trend of houses sold vs total revenue
2.Total sales by residential property type
3.Top towns by number of houses sold
4.Sale amount vs assessed value over the years
5.Interactive filters for year and town

Key Insights:
1.Single Family homes are by far the most sold property type, followed by Condos.
2.Cities like Bridgeport, Stamford, and Waterbury have the highest sales volumes.
3.The year 2021 shows a noticeable market peak in both revenue and volume of houses sold.

Highlight: Sale Amount vs. Assessed Value

One of the most interesting insights comes from comparing the "Sale Amount" (how much properties were actually sold for) with their  "Assessed Value" (used for tax purposes):

1.Throughout the years, sale prices are consistently higher than the assessed values.
2.This gap became even larger around 2020–2021, suggesting a strong seller’s market possibly due to lower interest rates or high post-pandemic demand.
3. In 2022, we can see both values start to drop, which might indicate the market is cooling down.
