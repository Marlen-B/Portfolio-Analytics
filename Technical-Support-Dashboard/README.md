# Key Insights – Technical Support Dashboard (2023)


The analysis of 2,330 technical support tickets shows that 66% were resolved within SLA, while 34% breached SLA, indicating a meaningful operational impact and clear opportunities for improvement.

One of the main drivers of SLA breaches is the ticket backlog. Throughout the entire period analyzed (January through December), approximately 400 tickets remained in backlog, and nearly all of them (399) failed to meet SLA. This pattern points to inefficiencies in backlog handling and ticket prioritization, directly affecting overall SLA performance.
At the topic level, Product Setup (119) and Pricing and Licensing (85) account for a significant share of SLA breaches. These categories likely require higher technical expertise, additional dependencies, or more realistic SLA definitions, making them recurring bottlenecks in the support process.
From an operational standpoint, the 1st line support team handles most of the ticket volume and shows an SLA breach rate ranging from 30% to 38%, suggesting overload at the initial triage stage, which contributes to ticket aging and backlog growth.

The 2nd line support team, despite managing lower volume, maintains an SLA breach rate between 28% and 33%, reinforcing that SLA issues are not driven by volume alone, but rather by cross-functional challenges related to prioritization, workload distribution, and escalation processes.

Finally, the average resolution time of 12.53 hours, while seemingly acceptable, masks the presence of critical and long-standing tickets, highlighting the need for complementary metrics such as ticket aging, resolution time percentiles, and backlog-focused monitoring to enable more effective support management.

This dashboard was developed to support operational decision-making in IT support environments, with a focus on SLA performance, backlog behavior, team efficiency, and bottleneck identification.
